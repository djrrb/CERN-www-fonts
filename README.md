## Project info

In February 2019, in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the World Wide Web, a team of developers and designers met at [CERN](https://www.cern.ch) to rebuild the original WorldWideWeb browser within a contemporary browser. 

The original WorldWideWeb browser was developed in 1990 on a [NeXT machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_Computer), and recreating the entirely text-based experience would require the “jaggies” of the bitmap fonts used by the [NeXTSTEP operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP). Attempts to remove `font-smoothing` from contemporary fonts did not get close enough to the original’s look and feel, so the team created the **CERN-www** family of pixel fonts, meticulously vectorized by hand to simulate the typography of the original WorldWideWeb.

The original sans serif fonts on the NeXT were versions of [Helvetica](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/44/helvetica), and the monospace was Ohlfs, designed by Keith Ohlfs.

Team members [Mark Boulton](http://markboulton.co.uk) and [Brian Suda](https://suda.co.uk) spearheaded the creation of the CERN-www fonts, and [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com) provided remote assistance with font development. 

As team member [Remy Sharp said](https://remysharp.com/2019/02/15/cern-day-4#it-looks-awfulwhich-is-great) about the project, “it looks awful...which is great!”
